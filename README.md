After using Guber tell us what you think..Click here for a breif survey: http://goo.gl/forms/ooU4On8M8O

We plan to make Guber run on a MEAN stack. The plan is to make a dynamic web app
for users. We chose this over an Android or iOS app to reach the broadest market.
We have a group set up in Trello to track our project.

* Matt - Project Manager: User stories (scenarios)
* Demetri - Lead Developer: Flowchart, UI mockup
* Austin - QA: Market study, Focus group survey
